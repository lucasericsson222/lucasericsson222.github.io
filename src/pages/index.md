<h1> <span class="tokipona" lang="tok"> kasi suli li pona mute a</span> Welcome!</h1>

Itho! I am Lucas Ericsson, an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science major at UC Berkeley.
For fun, I compose songs and work with Conlangs, while learning more about programming.

I'm currently learning about [Restricted Boltzmann Machines](/programming/restricted-boltzmann-machine) and Quantum Computing, but I also enjoy
web design projects.

I am learning [toki pona](https://tokipona.org/) and [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto), 
and I've experimented with creating a conlang through [Apmau'mur](/language/apmaumur).
