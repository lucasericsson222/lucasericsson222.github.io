Apmua'mur is a language about ducks!
Every word for a living being is derived from the word "duck" or "uampa."
Originally, it came from a joke in Spanish calling each other "pato", but it
now has become the greatest compliment to call someone a "good duck" or "uampa'tav" in
our language.

The main unique parts of this language are its <abbr>VSO</abbr> (Verb Subject Object) 
word order, its reversing of letter order to create opposing concept words, and 
the conjugation of the tense of a verb goes in front of a verb.

Since "apmau" is the reversed letter order of "uampa" it refers to the opposite concept, and 
"mur" is the word for "language."
So the name of this language is essentially: "Totally not a duck language."

This blog post covers the essential ideas needed for learning the language.

# Phonology / Romanization

<div class="rotated-table overflow-table">

| Consonants | Bilabial | Labiodental | Linguolabial | Alveolar | Postalveolar | Palatal | Labial-velar | Glottal |
| ---         | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nasal       | m   |  |  | n |  | ñ /ɲ/ |  |  |
| Plosive     | p   |  |  | t |  |  |  | ‘ /ʔ/ |
| Fricative   |     | v | th /ð/ | z | j /ʒ/ |  |  |  |
| Approximant |     |  |  | l | r /ɹ̠/ | y /j/ | w |  |
| Tap         |     |  |  | r |  |  |  |  |

</div>

<aside>
You might notice that there are two 'r' characters here. Apmau'mur started with using the /r/ 
between vowels and the <nobr>/ɹ̠/</nobr> when there is a consonant afterwords. However, we have also taken to
the habit of adding a /ə/ after the /r/ instead.
</aside>

----------------------------------------------

| Vowels | Front | Central | Back |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Close | i |  | u |
| Mid | e | ə | o |
| Open |  | a |  |

Each phoneme in the language uses the IPA symbol for the sound unless otherwise indicated; the exception to this is the schwa, which does not have a dedicated symbol but is instead used implicitly in certain consonant clusters. It is also used when the glottal stop is surrounded by consonants to ease in pronunciation.

The consonants were picked largely from English, reducing English’s inventory to a more simplified set of consonants, plus borrowing /ɲ/ and /r/ from Spanish.

The vowels consist of the five vowel system with the schwa included.

# Grammar

Apmau'mur’s sentences are written in Verb Subject Object (VSO) order. The goal is to place emphasis on the action.

For example: 

> A’imva oya ov. 
>
> [Present] (to want) (I) (food).
>
> I want food.

## Tenses

Tenses are indicated by the prefix to the verb. If a prefix ever has a vowel next to another vowel, a glottal stop (’) is inserted.

Our tenses include:
<div class="overflow-table"> 

| Tense |  | Prefix | Example | Translation | English |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Present | Simple (S) | a | A’ariz oya itho. | [Present] (to be) (I) (friendly) | I am friendly. |
|  | Continuous (C) | az | Azolñe aymi. | [Present Continuous] (to work) (They) | They are working. |
|  | Obligation (O) | av | Avet ila oznim. | [Present Obligation] (to learn) (you) (truth) | You have to learn the truth. |
|  | Perfect (P) | am | Ammazam ayo. | [Present Perfect] (to walk) (we) | We have ran. |
| Past | S | u |  |  |  |
|  | C | uz |  |  |  |
|  | O | uv |  |  |  |
|  | P | um |  |  |  |
| Future | S | i |  |  |  |
|  | C | iz |  |  |  |
|  | O | iv |  |  |  |
|  | P | im |  |  |  |
| Command |  | a’a | a’amazam‘erol | [Command] (to walk + end = stop walking)  | Stop walking! |

</div>

## Pronouns

Our personal pronouns are, by default, genderless, and the plural can be created by reversing the letter order of the characters for the singular pronoun. We also differentiate between they for objects and they for people.

| Personal Pronoun | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I | oya | ayo |
| You | ila | ali |
| him/her | imya | aymi |
| it | il | li |

For demonstrative pronouns, we have

| Demon<wbr>strative Pronoun | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| this | tol | lot |
| that | pol | lop |
| that (non-physical) | por | rop |

## Questions

All questions are created by using the word “uj” as “what.” “uj” can also function as a modifier to ask about the property of something else.

Common examples include:

> A’ariz pol uj?
> 
> [Present] (to be) (that) (what)?
>
> What is that?

> A’ariz uampa’tav’oya yu’uj?
> 
> [Present] (to be) (duck + good + I = my friend) (place + what = where)?
> 
> Where is my friend?

> A’zo ila uj?
>
> [Present] (to feel) (you) (what)?
> 
> How are you?

## Modifiers and Adjectives

To create new words, one can use two words and join them with a glottal stop (’) with the second word modifying the meaning of the first. 

You can see it clearly in this example:

> uampa
>
> (duck)

> uampa’oz
>
> (thinking duck = person)

> uampa’oz’et
> 
> (thinking duck take = thief)

> uampa’oz’et’vo
>
> (thinking duck take water = pirate)

This allows you to take simple starting words and combine them to create a more complicated word. The later words essentially function as adjectives and modify the concept of the original object.

## Conjunctions

We have the following conjunctions:

| apmau | eng |
| --- | --- |
| vim | and |
| miv | or |
| tir | because |
| vim’vat | but |

## Prepositions

We have the following prepositions:

| apmau | eng |
| --- | --- |
| pa | in |
| yu | at |
| apli | of |
| ilpa | to |
| yujol | on |
| laz | during |
| yaj | for |
| jay | with |
| ei | if |
| ie | then |

## Indirect Objects

Some verbs are transitive of degree two, which means that they can have an indirect object. To do this in Apmau’mur, you must use the word “uñe” before the indirect object.

Example:


> a’thua ila thua uñe oya.
>
> [Present] (to give) (you) (wealth) (to) (me)
>
> You give wealth to me.

<aside> This sentence also has a special meaning in this language which started as a joke: It also can be used as a great compliment to someone as in “You give value to my world/life.”
</aside>

## Opposing Concepts

To generate new words that are of the opposite concept, you can take a word and reverse the order of the characters.

For example:

> tav
>
> (good)
> 
> vat
>
> (bad)

Or another:

>
> lore
>
> (begin)
>
> erol
>
> (end)
